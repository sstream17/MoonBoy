** Color Palette Swapper **

Color Palette Swapper is a system projected to swaps sprites colors based on palettes. A palette swap is the process to swap a graphic element set of finite colors (commonly known as palettes) by another one, so this graphic element can be reused as a distinct new element or to indicate some gameplay change. On Unity, the graphic element is a texture or sprite. Using this technique, one sprite can be used to create many distincts gameobjects in the same game using differents palettes. This allow us to save both computer memory and development time.
